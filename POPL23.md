# `babble` POPL 2023 Artifact

This is the artifact for paper #94,
 "`babble`: Learning Better Abstractions with E-Graphs and Anti-Unification".

The canonical source for this artifact
 is the [Github repo](https://github.com/dcao/babble/tree/popl23),
 and an archival copy is on
 Zenodo with DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.7186946](https://zenodo.org/record/7186946).

# Claims

This artifact validates the following quantitative claims.

1. `babble` achieves better compression ratios than DreamCoder on the DreamCoder benchmarks,
  and it does so much faster than DreamCoder. (Figure 11)
2. `babble` achieves better compression when given domain-specific equivalences. (Figure 11)
3. `babble` can compress the larger CogSci benchmark suite as claimed in Table 2.

# Installation

The artifact requires
 relatively few dependencies if you'd prefer to run on your own machine.

- Rust version > 1.63
- Python > 3.8, including packages:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
- GNU make

The artifact will likely be easier and faster to run on your own
 machine if you can install the above dependencies.
Alternatively, you can use the VM provided in the [Zenodo archival copy](https://zenodo.org/record/7186946)
 that has everything pre-installed.

## Manual installation

Install the above dependencies.

Clone the project using the `--recursive` flag to get the submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive -b popl23 https://github.com/dcao/babble.git
cd babble
```

If you are working with an existing clone, make sure to pull the submodules.
A fresh clone using the `--recursive` flag won't need this.

```bash
git checkout popl23
git submodule init
git pull --recurse-submodules 
```

## Using the VM

The [Zenodo upload](https://zenodo.org/record/7186946)
includes a virtual machine you may use to reproduce the artifact.

The VM is shipped as a VirtualBox appliance (`.ova` file).
First, [download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) VirtualBox 6 for your host machine.
From VirtualBox, you can then import the appliance with `File > Import Appliance`.
Make sure the VM settings are valid for your hardware (check memory, CPU cores etc. in `Settings > System`),
and adjust accordingly if not.
The VM comes with 8GB of memory and 6 CPU cores allocated by default.
Allocate as many cores as you can (up to n-2, where n is the number of cores on your machine),
 as the eval uses significant parallelism.

The VM is running Ubuntu 22.04, the user is `babble`, and the password is `popl23`.
All necessary dependencies have already been installed,
  and programs have been pre-compiled.
This repository is already present at `~/babble`; navigate there in the terminal to proceed.
You can perform a `git pull` from that directory to grab the latest version of this document.
Everything in the VM is "already run", i.e.,
 the commands below **will only regenerate the plots**,
 not actually do any work.
If you'd like to re-run the eval, run `make clean` first.

*NOTE*:
 Performance in the VM will likely be worse in both
 single-core and parallel performance,
 so some times will be longer.

# Running the evaluation

## Sanity check / Kick the tires

Check that everything is okay by building `babble`,
 this is done automatically by the `Makefile`,
 but it's a quick way to check that things are working.
This takes about 2 minutes on a 6-core laptop.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

From the `babble` directory, then run:

```bash
make plots-quick
```

This runs a subset of the evaluation (a subset of the the `physics` benchmark).
It runs in parallel, taking about 1.5 minutes on a 6-core laptop.
Like `make plots`, it will print the names of the plots created under `harness/plots`.
Those plots should look like those from Figure 11.
(Note that `make plots-quick` will omit some data, so the plot will re-scale).

## Figure 11: Babble vs Dreamcoder plots

Run `make plots`. This takes about 10 minutes on a 6-core laptop.
The plots are stored in `harness/plots` as both pdfs and pngs.

### Validate Claim 1

Inspect the following plots the comprise Figure 11.
These links will only be clickable after running `make plots`.

- Fig 11a: [`harness/plots/list.png`](harness/plots/list.png)
- Fig 11b: [`harness/plots/physics.png`](harness/plots/physics.png)
- Fig 11c: [`harness/plots/text.png`](harness/plots/text.png)
- Fig 11d: [`harness/plots/logo.png`](harness/plots/logo.png)
- Fig 11e: [`harness/plots/towers.png`](harness/plots/towers.png)

To validate claim 1,
 observe that `babble` (blue X)
 tends to be down (faster)
 and to the right (higher/better compression ratio)
 than DreamCoder (purple O).

The DreamCoder numbers are pulled from a log,
 and should be identical to those in the paper.
The `babble` compression ratios should not vary,
 but the time may depending on your machine.
Regardless, it should be considerably faster than DreamCoder.

### Validate Claim 2

Inspect the following plots the comprise Figure 11.
These links will only be clickable after running `make plots`.

- Fig 11a: [`harness/plots/list.png`](harness/plots/list.png)
- Fig 11b: [`harness/plots/physics.png`](harness/plots/physics.png)

We only supplied domain-specific rewrites for the list and physics domains.

"BabbleSyn" (green triangle) denotes
 `babble` without any domain-specific rewrites (it just does "syntactic" learning).
Observe that BabbleSyn does not compress as well as `babble`, it's further left.

"EqSat" (red triangle) denotes
 just running equality saturation with the domain-specific rewrites,
 but not doing library learning.
This baseline should run very quickly (low on the graph),
 but achieve relatively little compression,
 since it is not learning any abstractions.

## Table 2: Babble on CogSci dataset

Run `make cogsci-table`.
This takes about 3-4 minutes on a 6-core laptop.
This prints a latex formatted table that looks something like the following:

```latex
Nuts \& Bolts   &      19009 &       2059 &       9.23 &      27.89 &       1744 &      10.90 &      62.72
Vehicles        &      35427 &       6477 &       5.47 &     113.45 &       5505 &       6.44 &     114.75
Gadgets         &      35713 &       6798 &       5.25 &     108.22 &       5037 &       7.09 &     119.30
Furniture       &      42936 &      10539 &       4.07 &     167.18 &       9417 &       4.56 &     146.73
Nuts \& Bolts (clean) &      18259 &       2215 &       8.24 &      30.38 &       1744 &      10.47 &      66.06
```

It also writes the scatterplot from Figure 12 at
[`harness/plots/cogsci-scatter.png`](harness/plots/cogsci-scatter.png)

### Validate Claim 3

Inspect the table printed by `make cogsci-table`.
You can freely re-run this command to regenerate the table,
 the results will be cached after the first run.

The columns are the same as those in the paper.
Confirm that this data is the same as that shown in the paper,
 modulo small variation in the time columns depending on your machine.

# Guide to project structure

The top level of the `babble` project folder contains several folders and files. Of the top-level files, one is of particular interest: the `Makefile` is used as the task runner for generating the various evaluation figures. Full usage of the `Makefile` to reproduce the evaluation results in the paper are detailed above. The `Makefile` also contains several commands to build the project, which are detailed in the file itself.

The project has four top-level folders total. Two of these are somewhat auxiliary: the `babble-macros` folder is a Rust crate which defines a macro `rewrite_rules`, used during development for adding rewrite rules ad-hoc while running equality saturation, while the `examples` folder contains a list of `babble` examples used for testing and demo purposes (these examples aren't used for the actual evaluation in the `babble` paper).

Outside of this, the main two sub-folders of interest are `src` and `harness`. `src` contains all the source code for `babble` itself, while `harness` contains all evaluation-related files: the data needed to generate the evaluation, the generated files created in the process of generating the evaluation, and the scripts which generate the evaluation. We detail the structure of each of these parts of the `babble` project below.

## `src`

`src` contains the actual source code for the `babble` project. `babble` is structured as a library and a set of binaries. The library contains all of the core algorithms and ingredients needed to perform library learning over an arbitrary instance of an `egg` `Language` (e.g. implementations of e-graph anti-unification and beam extraction, etc.).

`babble` also contains a set of binaries, located in the `bin` directory, used for testing and evaluation purposes. The `benchmark` and `compression` binaries are responsible for running `babble` on a single instance of the DreamCoder benchmarks and the 2D CAD benchmarks, respectively. These binaries define `egg` `Language`s corresponding to the input formats of the DreamCoder and 2D CAD domains. The `drawings`, `list`, and `smiley` binaries are responsible for running `babble` on other languages used for testing. Finally, the `parse_dc` and `print_benchmarks` binaries are strictly used for the `babble` paper evaluation; the former parses trace files from DreamCoder executions and reports execution time and compression, while `print_benchmarks` simply reports a list of DreamCoder benchmarks from a directory contain DreamCoder execution traces.

## `harness`

`harness` contains everything relevant to running the `babble` evaluation. This directory is divided into three parts:

### `harness/data`

The raw input data used for evaluating `babble`. This includes the DreamCoder benchmarks and trace executions (`dreamcoder-benchmarks`), the 2D CAD input dataset (`cogsci`), and the domain-specific rewrites used for each benchmark (`benchmark-dsrs`).

### `harness/data_gen`

Intermediate files generated from the raw input data, used for figure generation. This is where `babble` saves statistics about execution time and compression ratio, and this is where the `parse_dc` binary saves info from parsing DreamCoder evaluation traces (`harness/data_gen/dc_res.csv`).

### `harness/plots`

This generated directory is where plots for the evaluation are saved.

### `harness/scripts`

This directory contains the scripts used to orchestrate `babble` invocations and turn `babble` execution statistics into the evaluation figures seen in the paper. The two main scripts of interest are `plot.py`, used for generating Fig. 11, and `cogsci-table.py`, used for generating Table 2 and Fig. 12. Changing the experiments done for each of these scripts can be done by modifying the listed experiments at the bottom of each of these files.
